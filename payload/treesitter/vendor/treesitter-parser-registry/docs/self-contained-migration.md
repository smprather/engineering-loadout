# Migrating to Self-Contained Queries

This guide is for **parser maintainers** who want to ship Neovim queries
directly in their `tree-sitter-<lang>` repository instead of relying on
a separate `nvim-treesitter-queries-<lang>` repo.

When a parser is self-contained, the registry points directly at the
upstream repo and the installer fetches queries from there. This gives
parser authors full control over query quality and lets query changes
land alongside grammar changes in the same PR.

## Overview

| Step | What | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Add nvim query files to your parser repo | `tree-sitter-<lang>` |
| 2 | Create `parser.json` | `tree-sitter-<lang>` |
| 3 | (Optional) Add highlight assertion tests | `tree-sitter-<lang>` |
| 4 | Add the reusable CI workflow | `tree-sitter-<lang>` |
| 5 | Update the registry entry to `self_contained` | `treesitter-parser-registry` |
| 6 | (Optional) Archive the old query repo | `neovim-treesitter` org |

---

## Step 1 — Add Neovim query files

Create a directory in your parser repo to hold the Neovim-specific queries.
The recommended layout uses a parent directory with a `<lang>/` subdirectory:

```
tree-sitter-mylang/
├── grammar.js
├── src/
├── queries/              # generic tree-sitter queries (highlights.scm etc.)
├── nvim-queries/         # Neovim-specific queries and tests
│   ├── mylang/
│   │   ├── highlights.scm
│   │   ├── injections.scm    (optional)
│   │   ├── folds.scm         (optional)
│   │   ├── indents.scm       (optional)
│   │   └── locals.scm        (optional)
│   └── tests/                # highlight assertion tests for the queries
│       └── test.mylang
└── ...
```

The `nvim-queries/<lang>/` layout is recommended because it maps cleanly to
the `queries_dir` field in `parser.json`. However, you can also place queries
directly in a flat directory (e.g. `queries/nvim/`) and use `queries_path`
instead.

### If migrating from an existing query repo

Copy the `.scm` files from the `nvim-treesitter-queries-<lang>` repo's
`queries/` directory into your new `nvim-queries/<lang>/` directory:

```bash
# Clone the existing query repo
git clone https://github.com/neovim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-queries-mylang /tmp/queries-mylang

# Copy queries into your parser repo
mkdir -p nvim-queries/mylang
cp /tmp/queries-mylang/queries/*.scm nvim-queries/mylang/
```

Verify the queries still work against your current grammar — if you have
recently changed node names or structure, the queries may need updating.

### `.tsqueryrc.json`

Add a `.tsqueryrc.json` at your repo root so `ts_query_ls` can find queries
during local development:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ribru17/ts_query_ls/refs/heads/master/schemas/config.json",
  "parser_install_directories": ["."],
  "language_retrieval_patterns": [
    "nvim-queries/([^/]+)/[^/]+\\.scm$"
  ]
}
```

Adjust the pattern if you use a different directory layout.

---

## Step 2 — Create `parser.json`

Add a `parser.json` file at the root of your parser repo. This is the
single source of truth for the CI workflow and the nvim-treesitter
installer — it tells them where queries and tests live, what language
the parser provides, and what build flags are needed.

### Minimal example

```json
{
    "lang": "mylang",
    "queries_dir": "nvim-queries"
}
```

### With highlight tests and optional fields

```json
{
    "lang": "mylang",
    "queries_dir": "nvim-queries",
    "test_dir": "nvim-queries/tests",
    "inject_deps": ["html", "css"],
    "location": "tree-sitter-mylang"
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `lang` | **Yes** | Language name. Must match the subdirectory name under `queries_dir`. |
| `queries_dir` | One of these | Parent directory whose `<lang>/` subdirectory contains `.scm` files (e.g. `"nvim-queries"`). |
| `queries_path` | | Direct path to directory containing `.scm` files. Mutually exclusive with `queries_dir`. |
| `test_dir` | No | Directory containing highlight assertion test files (e.g. `"tests/highlights"`). If present, CI runs the tests. |
| `location` | No | Subdirectory containing parser source, for monorepo layouts. |
| `inject_deps` | No | Array of languages whose parsers are needed for injection validation. |
| `inherits` | No | Object mapping inherited language names to `{ "url": "...", "parser_version": "..." }`. |
| `generate` | No | Set `true` when `tree-sitter generate` is needed before compilation. |
| `generate_from_json` | No | When `generate` is true: `true` = use `src/grammar.json`, `false` = use `grammar.js`. |

The full schema is in
[`schemas/schema.json`](../schemas/schema.json)
(see the `parserManifest` definition).

---

## Step 3 — (Optional) Add highlight assertion tests

If the old query repo had highlight assertion tests in `tests/highlights/`,
copy them into your parser repo alongside the queries:

```bash
# From the old query repo
mkdir -p nvim-queries/tests
cp /tmp/queries-mylang/tests/highlights/* nvim-queries/tests/
```

The layout should be:

```
tree-sitter-mylang/
├── test/                 # existing tree-sitter grammar tests (corpus)
│   └── corpus/
├── nvim-queries/         # everything query-related lives here
│   ├── mylang/
│   │   └── highlights.scm ...
│   └── tests/            # highlight assertion tests for the queries
│       └── test.mylang
├── parser.json           # declares test_dir: "nvim-queries/tests"
└── ...
```

Query tests live under `nvim-queries/tests/` because they test the
**queries**, not the parser grammar. This keeps them co-located with
the `.scm` files they exercise and cleanly separated from the grammar's
own `test/corpus/` tests.

Highlight assertion tests use comment annotations to verify that the
highlight query assigns the expected capture groups:

```zsh
echo "Hello"
#^^^ @function.call @function.builtin
#    ^^^^^^^ @string
```

Set `"test_dir": "tests/highlights"` in `parser.json` so CI picks them up.

---

## Step 4 — Add CI

Add a workflow file that calls the reusable validation workflow from the
`neovim-treesitter` org. The workflow reads `parser.json` for all
configuration — no per-repo inputs are needed.

Create `.github/workflows/nvim-queries.yml`:

```yaml
name: Validate Queries (Self-Contained)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "nvim-queries/mylang/**"
      - "tests/**"
      - "parser.json"
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "nvim-queries/mylang/**"
      - "tests/**"
      - "parser.json"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  validate:
    uses: neovim-treesitter/.github/.github/workflows/self-contained-validate.yml@main
```

That's it. The reusable workflow reads `parser.json` from your repo root
to determine the language name, query directory, test directory, injection
dependencies, and all other settings. You can override any value by passing
explicit `with:` inputs, but for most repos `parser.json` is sufficient.

### Adding to an existing CI workflow

If your parser already has a CI workflow, add query validation as an
additional job and extend the path triggers:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - grammar.js
      - src/**
      - test/**
      - nvim-queries/**      # <-- add this
      - tests/**             # <-- add this
      - parser.json          # <-- add this
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - grammar.js
      - src/**
      - test/**
      - nvim-queries/**
      - tests/**
      - parser.json

jobs:
  test:
    # ... existing parser test job ...

  query:
    name: Validate queries
    uses: neovim-treesitter/.github/.github/workflows/self-contained-validate.yml@main
```

### What CI validates

1. **Parser build** — compiles the parser from your repo using `tree-sitter build`
2. **Query correctness** — `ts_query_ls check` verifies all `.scm` files against
   the compiled parser (invalid node names, malformed predicates, type errors)
3. **Inherited queries** — if your queries use `; inherits:` directives, CI fetches
   the parent query repos and validates the merged set
4. **Injection deps** — if specified in `parser.json`, builds parsers for injected languages
5. **Highlight tests** — if `test_dir` is set in `parser.json` and the directory
   exists, runs highlight assertion tests using
   [`highlight-assertions`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/highlight-assertions)

---

## Step 5 — Update the registry

Open a PR against
[`treesitter-parser-registry`](https://github.com/neovim-treesitter/treesitter-parser-registry)
to change your language's entry in `registry.json` from `external_queries`
to `self_contained`.

### Before (external_queries)

```json
"mylang": {
  "filetypes": ["mylang"],
  "source": {
    "type": "external_queries",
    "parser_url": "https://github.com/author/tree-sitter-mylang",
    "parser_semver": true,
    "queries_url": "https://github.com/neovim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-queries-mylang",
    "queries_semver": true
  }
}
```

### After (self_contained)

```json
"mylang": {
  "filetypes": ["mylang"],
  "source": {
    "type": "self_contained",
    "url": "https://github.com/author/tree-sitter-mylang",
    "semver": true,
    "queries_dir": "nvim-queries"
  }
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | Yes | `"self_contained"` |
| `url` | Yes | Git URL of your parser repo |
| `semver` | Yes | `true` if you publish semver tags, `false` otherwise |
| `queries_dir` | One of | Parent dir whose `<lang>/` subdirectory has `.scm` files |
| `queries_path` | these | Direct path to directory containing `.scm` files |
| `location` | No | Subdirectory for monorepo parsers |
| `generate` | No | Set `true` if `tree-sitter generate` is needed before build |
| `generate_from_json` | No | `true` to generate from `src/grammar.json` |

### PR checklist

- [ ] Source type changed to `self_contained`
- [ ] `url` points at your parser repo
- [ ] `queries_dir` or `queries_path` matches your actual layout
- [ ] `semver` reflects whether you publish semver tags
- [ ] Your parser repo has a `parser.json` with at least `lang` and `queries_dir`
- [ ] Your parser repo CI passes with the reusable workflow
- [ ] `filetypes` and `requires` fields preserved from old entry

---

## Step 6 — (Optional) Archive the old query repo

Once the registry PR is merged, the old `nvim-treesitter-queries-<lang>`
repo is no longer the source of truth. Notify the `neovim-treesitter` org
maintainers to archive it. The archive preserves history while clearly
signalling that queries now live upstream.

If you do not have access to archive the repo, mention it in your registry
PR and an org maintainer will handle it.

## Worked example: `tree-sitter-zsh`

The `tree-sitter-zsh` parser is the reference implementation for self-contained
queries. Here is exactly what was done:

### Repo layout

```
tree-sitter-zsh/
├── parser.json
├── nvim-queries/
│   ├── zsh/
│   │   ├── highlights.scm
│   │   ├── injections.scm
│   │   ├── locals.scm
│   │   └── folds.scm
│   └── tests/
│       └── test.zsh
├── test/
│   └── corpus/           # existing grammar tests (unchanged)
├── .tsqueryrc.json
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── validate-queries.yml
```

### `parser.json`

```json
{
    "lang": "zsh",
    "queries_dir": "nvim-queries",
    "test_dir": "nvim-queries/tests"
}
```

### CI workflow (`.github/workflows/validate-queries.yml`)

```yaml
name: Validate Queries (Self-Contained)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "nvim-queries/zsh/**"
      - "tests/**"
      - "parser.json"
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "nvim-queries/zsh/**"
      - "tests/**"
      - "parser.json"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  validate:
    uses: neovim-treesitter/.github/.github/workflows/self-contained-validate.yml@main
```

No `with:` inputs needed — everything comes from `parser.json`.

### Registry entry

```json
"zsh": {
  "filetypes": ["zsh"],
  "source": {
    "type": "self_contained",
    "url": "https://github.com/georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh",
    "semver": false,
    "queries_dir": "nvim-queries"
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### Can I keep both the query repo and self-contained queries?

During migration, yes. The registry entry determines which source the
installer uses. While the entry says `external_queries`, the query repo
is canonical. Once you flip it to `self_contained`, the installer fetches
from your parser repo. The query repo can remain as a read-only archive.

### What if my queries use `; inherits:`?

The reusable workflow handles this automatically. It scans your `.scm`
files for `; inherits:` directives and fetches the parent query repos
via BFS. You can also declare explicit dependencies in `parser.json`
via the `inherits` field.

You should also keep `requires` in your registry entry so the installer
knows about the dependency chain.

### What if my parser is in a monorepo?

Set `"location"` in `parser.json` to the subdirectory containing your
parser source. Also set `location` in the registry entry.

### Do I need to change how I release?

No. The installer discovers versions the same way — via semver tags
(if `semver: true`) or HEAD (if `semver: false`). The only difference
is that queries are now fetched from the same repo and ref as the parser.

### What about the `queries/` directory at the repo root?

The generic `queries/highlights.scm` (used by the tree-sitter CLI
playground and other non-Neovim tools) is separate from the
`nvim-queries/` directory. Keep both — they serve different audiences.

### What's the difference between `test/` and `nvim-queries/tests/`?

- `test/corpus/` — standard tree-sitter grammar tests (parse tree snapshots).
  Run by `tree-sitter test`. These test the **parser**.
- `nvim-queries/tests/` — Neovim highlight assertion tests. Run by
  `highlight-assertions` in CI. These test the **queries** — verifying that
  the highlight query assigns the expected capture groups to source code ranges.

Both can coexist. They test different things and are run by different tools.
Query tests live alongside the queries under `nvim-queries/` because they
are semantically tied to the `.scm` files, not the grammar.
