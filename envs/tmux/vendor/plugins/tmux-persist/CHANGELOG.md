# Changelog

### v5.1.2, 2026-06-22

- Extends AI agent CLI session restore to five more agents, all on by default:
  GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot --continue`), Cursor (`cursor-agent --continue`),
  Antigravity (`agy --continue`), Gemini CLI (`gemini --resume`) and `opencode`
  (`opencode --continue`). Each rewrites a bare launch into the CLI's own
  resume-most-recent form and preserves an explicit by-id resume. See
  [restoring AI agent CLI sessions](docs/restoring_agent_sessions.md).

### v5.1.1, 2026-06-22

- Restores AI agent CLI sessions. `claude` and `codex` panes now resume their
  most recent conversation on restore (`claude --continue`, `codex resume
  --last`) instead of launching empty; an explicit `--resume`/`-r` (claude) or
  `resume`/`fork` (codex) you already typed is preserved. Both are in the default
  process list, so it works with no configuration. See
  [restoring AI agent CLI sessions](docs/restoring_agent_sessions.md). Adapted
  from upstream tmux-resurrect [#558](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect/pull/558);
  see [`docs/upstream-pr-review.md`](docs/upstream-pr-review.md) for the
  comparison against [#571](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect/pull/571)
  and [#572](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect/pull/572).

- Saves whose content is byte-identical to a session's latest snapshot no longer
  write a duplicate file; the existing snapshot's mtime is refreshed instead so
  age-based pruning keeps it alive. This keeps auto-save-on-detach from piling up
  identical snapshots. Toggle with `@persist-skip-unchanged` (default `on`).

### v5.1.0, 2026-06-20

- Restored panes no longer pile up duplicate shell prompts. The trailing prompt is
  stripped from saved pane contents, and snapshots already bloated by earlier
  versions clean themselves up on the next save. Works with any prompt, keeps your
  commands and their output, and applies whether you detach or exit with
  `Ctrl-d`.

### v5.0.0, 2026-06-20

First release of the `tmux-persist` fork. Upgrading from tmux-resurrect needs no
changes: existing config keeps working and saved data is migrated automatically.

- Automatically migrates a tmux-resurrect global snapshot
  (`tmux_resurrect_<ts>.txt` + shared `pane_contents.tar.gz`) into per-session
  tmux-persist snapshots on first load. Runs once, never overwrites an existing
  persist snapshot.
- Backward compatible with tmux-resurrect config: any unset `@persist-*` option
  falls back to its old `@resurrect-*` name, and the legacy `~/.tmux/resurrect`
  (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tmux/resurrect`) directory is used if no persist dir
  exists. Old options still work but are deprecated (a one-time notice advises
  renaming them).
- CI moved from Travis to GitHub Actions; the test suite runs on every pull
  request (and on demand via workflow_dispatch).
- Disabling `@persist-save-on-exit` / `@persist-auto-restore` now removes the
  corresponding tmux hooks (previously toggling off left them active until the
  server restarted).
- Replaced the old tmux-test/expect tests with a self-contained suite
  (`./tests/run.sh`) covering per-session save/restore, capture-by-default,
  save-all, auto-restore on creation, age/cap/expiry/collision pruning, and the
  together/separate snapshot formats. Dropped the `tmux-test` submodule.
- Pane contents are now stored **inside each snapshot** instead of one shared
  per-session archive, so historical snapshots keep their own contents. New
  `@persist-snapshot-format` chooses how: `together` (default; one
  `<session>_<timestamp>.tgz`) or `separate` (a `.txt` layout plus a
  `_pane_contents.tgz` companion). Restore auto-detects the format.
- Added `@persist-max-snapshots` to cap how many snapshots each session keeps
  (newest kept; default `0` = unlimited). Composes with age-based pruning.
- Snapshot retention is now purely age-based: snapshots older than
  `@persist-delete-backup-after` days (default **7**, was 30 with a 5-copy
  floor) are erased automatically on save and on server start. When all of a
  session's snapshots expire, its `last` pointer and pane-contents archive are
  removed too. Pruning is collision-safe (`a` never affects `a_b`).
- Renamed the project to `tmux-persist`; tmux options are now `@persist-*` and
  the default save directory is `~/.tmux/persist` (or
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tmux/persist`).
- Pane-contents capture is now **enabled by default** (set
  `@persist-capture-pane-contents 'off'` to disable).
- **Auto-save on exit.** Sessions are saved automatically on the
  `client-detached` and `session-closed` tmux hooks (covers detaching,
  disconnecting and exiting). Disable with `@persist-save-on-exit 'off'`.
- **Per-session save and restore.** Each session is now saved to its own files
  named `<session>_*` (`<session>_<timestamp>.txt`, `<session>_last`,
  `<session>_pane_contents.tar.gz`) instead of one shared `last` /
  `tmux_resurrect_*.txt` / `pane_contents.tar.gz`. Restore acts on the session
  you are attached to (or a session name passed to `restore.sh`) and no longer
  recreates or switches to other sessions — fixing the bug where restoring one
  session pulled in another's panes/contents.

### v2.4.0, 2015-02-23
- add "tmux-test"
- add test for "persist save" feature
- add test for "persist restore" feature
- make the tests work and pass on travis
- add travis badge to the readme

### v2.3.0, 2015-02-12
- Improve fetching proper window_layout for zoomed windows. In order to fetch
  proper value, window has to get unzoomed. This is now done faster so that
  "unzoom,fetch value,zoom" cycle is almost unnoticable to the user.

### v2.2.0, 2015-02-12
- bugfix: zoomed windows related regression
- export save and restore script paths so that 'tmux-persist-save' plugin can
  use them
- enable "quiet" saving (used by 'tmux-persist-save' plugin)

### v2.1.0, 2015-02-12
- if restore is started when there's only **1 pane in the whole tmux server**,
  assume the users wants the "full restore" and overrwrite that pane.

### v2.0.0, 2015-02-10
- add link to the wiki page for "first pane/window issue" to the README as well
  as other tweaks
- save and restore grouped sessions (used with multi-monitor workflow)
- save and restore active and alternate windows in grouped sessions
- if there are no grouped sessions, do not output empty line to "last" file
- restore active and alternate windows only if they are present in the "last" file
- refactoring: prefer using variable with tab character
- remove deprecated `M-s` and `M-r` key bindings (breaking change)

### v1.5.0, 2014-11-09
- add support for restoring neovim sessions

### v1.4.0, 2014-10-25
- plugin now uses strategies when fetching pane full command. Implemented
  'default' strategy.
- save command strategy: 'pgrep'. It's here only if fallback is needed.
- save command strategy: 'gdb'
- rename default strategy name to 'ps'
- create `expect` script that can fully restore tmux environment
- fix default save command strategy `ps` command flags. Flags are different for
  FreeBSD.
- add bash history saving and restoring (@rburny)
- preserving layout of zoomed windows across restores (@Azrael3000)

### v1.3.0, 2014-09-20
- remove dependency on `pgrep` command. Use `ps` for fetching process names.

### v1.2.1, 2014-09-02
- tweak 'new_pane' creation strategy to fix #36
- when running multiple tmux server and for a large number of panes (120 +) when
  doing a restore, some panes might not be created. When that is the case also
  don't restore programs for those panes.

### v1.2.0, 2014-09-01
- new feature: inline strategies when restoring a program

### v1.1.0, 2014-08-31
- bugfix: sourcing `variables.sh` file in save script
- add `Ctrl` key mappings, deprecate `Alt` keys mappings.

### v1.0.0, 2014-08-30
- show spinner during the save process
- add screencast script
- make default program running list even more conservative

### v0.4.0, 2014-08-29
- change plugin name to `tmux-persist`. Change all the variable names.

### v0.3.0, 2014-08-29
- bugfix: when top is running the pane `$PWD` can't be saved. This was causing
  issues during the restore and is now fixed.
- restoring sessions multiple times messes up the whole environment - new panes
  are all around. This is now fixed - pane restorations are now idempotent.
- if pane exists from before session restore - do not restore the process within
  it. This makes the restoration process even more idempotent.
- more panes within a window can now be restored
- restore window zoom state

### v0.2.0, 2014-08-29
- bugfix: with vim 'session' strategy, if the session file does not exist - make
  sure vim does not contain `-S` flag
- enable restoring programs with arguments (e.g. "rails console") and also
  processes that contain program name
- improve `irb` restore strategy

- display a nice error message if saved session file does not exist
- added README

### v0.0.1, 2014-08-26
- started a project
- basic saving and restoring works
