### General instructions <a name="general-instructions"></a>
Only a conservative list of programs is restored by default - see
`@persist-default-processes` in [the options reference](options.md) for the
exact list, which also includes AI agent CLIs
([details](restoring_agent_sessions.md)).

This can be configured with `@persist-processes` option in `.tmux.conf`. It
contains space-separated list of additional programs to restore.

- Example restoring additional programs:

        set -g @persist-processes 'ssh psql mysql sqlite3'

- Programs with arguments should be double quoted:

        set -g @persist-processes 'some_program "git log"'

- Start with tilde to restore a program whose process contains target name:

        set -g @persist-processes 'irb pry "~rails server" "~rails console"'

- Use `->` to specify a command to be used when restoring a program (useful if
  the default restore command fails ):

        set -g @persist-processes 'some_program "grunt->grunt development"'

- Use `*` to expand the arguments from the saved command when restoring:

        set -g @persist-processes 'some_program "~rails server->rails server *"'

- Don't restore any programs:

        set -g @persist-processes 'false'

- Restore **all** programs (dangerous!):

        set -g @persist-processes ':all:'

  Be *very careful* with this: tmux-persist can not know which programs take
  which context, and a `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb` that was just formatting an
  external USB stick could wipe your backup hard disk if that's what's attached
  after rebooting.

  This option is primarily useful for experimentation (e.g., to find out which
  program is recognized in a pane).

### Clarifications <a name="clarfications"></a>

> I don't understand tilde `~`, what is it and why is it used when restoring
  programs?

Let's say you use `rails server` command often. You want `tmux-persist` to
save and restore it automatically. You might try adding `rails server` to the
list of programs that will be restored:

    set -g @persist-processes '"rails server"'  # will NOT work

Upon save, `rails server` command will actually be saved as this command:
`/Users/user/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p481/bin/ruby script/rails server`
(if you wanna see how any command was saved, check it yourself: each
session's snapshot is its own `<session>_last` file in `~/.tmux/persist/`;
extract and search its layout with
`tar xzOf ~/.tmux/persist/<session>_last ./layout | grep rails`).

When programs are restored, the `rails server` command will NOT be restored
because it does not **strictly** match the long
`/Users/user/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p481/bin/ruby script/rails server` string.

The tilde `~` at the start of the string relaxes process name matching.

    set -g @persist-processes '"~rails server"'  # OK

The above option says: "restore full process if `rails server` string is found
ANYWHERE in the process name".

If you check long process string, there is in fact a `rails server` string at
the end, so now the process will be successfully restored.

> What is arrow `->` and why is is used?

(Please read the above clarification about tilde `~`).

Continuing with our `rails server` example, when the process is finally restored
correctly it might not look pretty as you'll see the whole
`/Users/user/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p481/bin/ruby script/rails server` string in
the command line.

Naturally, you'd rather want to see just `rails server` (what you initially
typed), but that information is now unfortunately lost.

To aid this, you can use arrow `->`: (**note**: there is no space before and after `->`)

    set -g @persist-processes '"~rails server->rails server"'  # OK

This option says: "when this process is restored use `rails server` as the
command name".

Full (long) process name is now ignored and you'll see just `rails server` in
the command line when the program is restored.

> What is asterisk `*` and why is it used?

(Please read the above clarifications about tilde `~` and arrow `->`).

Continuing with the `rails server` example, you might have added flags for e.g.
verbose logging, but with the above configuration, the flags would be lost.

To preserve the command arguments when restoring, use the asterisk `*`: (**note**: there **must** be a space before `*`)

    set -g @persist-processes '"~rails server->rails server *"'

This option says: "when this process is restored use `rails server` as the
command name, but preserve its arguments".

> Now I understand the tilde and the arrow, but things still don't work for me

Here's the general workflow for figuring this out:

- Set up your whole tmux environment manually.<br/>
  In our example case, we'd type `rails server` in a pane where we want it to
  run.
- Save the session (`prefix + Ctrl-s`) - it lands in
  `~/.tmux/persist/<session>_last`.
- Extract and search its layout for the full process string:
  `tar xzOf ~/.tmux/persist/<session>_last ./layout | grep rails`.<br/>
  Unfortunately this is a little vague but it should be easy.
- Now that you know the full and the desired process string use tilde `~` and
  arrow `->` in `.tmux.conf` to make things work.

### Working with NodeJS <a name="nodejs"></a>
If you are working with NodeJS, you may get some troubles with configuring restoring programs.

Particularly, some programs like `gulp`, `grunt` or `npm` are not saved with parameters so tmux-persist cannot restore it. This is actually **not tmux-persist's issue** but more likely, those programs' issues. For example if you run `gulp watch` or `npm start` and then try to look at `ps` or `pgrep`, you will only see `gulp` or `npm`.

To deal with these issues, one solution is to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) which a package manager for NodeJS and an alternative for `npm`. It's nearly identical to `npm` and very easy to use. Therefore you don't have to do any migration, you can simply use it immediately. For example:
- `npm test` is equivalent to `yarn test`,
- `npm run watch:dev` is equivalent to `yarn watch:dev`
- more interestingly, `gulp watch:dev` is equivalent to `yarn gulp watch:dev`

Before continuing, please ensure that you understand the [clarifications](#clarifications) section about `~` and `->`

#### yarn
It's fairly straight forward if you have been using `yarn` already.

    set -g @persist-processes '"~yarn watch"'
    set -g @persist-processes '"~yarn watch->yarn watch"'


#### npm
Instead of

    set -g @persist-processes '"~npm run watch"'  # will NOT work

we use

    set -g @persist-processes '"~yarn watch"'     # OK


#### gulp
Instead of

    set -g @persist-processes '"~gulp test"'      # will NOT work

we use

    set -g @persist-processes '"~yarn gulp test"' # OK


#### nvm
If you use `nvm` in your project, here is how you could config tmux-persist:

    set -g @persist-processes '"~yarn gulp test->nvm use && gulp test"'

#### Another problem
Let take a look at this example

    set -g @persist-processes '\
          "~yarn gulp test->gulp test" \
          "~yarn gulp test-it->gulp test-it" \
    '
**This will not work properly**, only `gulp test` is run, although you can see the command `node /path/to/yarn gulp test-it` is added correctly in the session's saved layout (see the general workflow above for how to check).

The reason is when restoring program, the **command part after the dash `-` is ignored** so instead  of command `gulp test-it`, the command `gulp test` which will be run.

A work around, for this problem until it's fixed, is:
- the config should be like this:

      set -g @persist-processes '\
          "~yarn gulp test->gulp test" \
          "~yarn gulp \"test-it\"->gulp test-it" \

- and in the session's saved layout, we should add quote to `test-it` word

      ... node:node /path/to/yarn gulp "test-it"


### Restoring Mosh <a name="#mosh"></a>
Mosh spawns a `mosh-client` process, so we need to specify that as the process to be persisted.

    set -g @persist-processes 'mosh-client'

Additionally a mosh-client strategy is provided to handle extracting the original arguments and re-run Mosh.
