# Automatic saving and restoring

`tmux-persist` installs a few tmux hooks so you rarely have to think about
saving or restoring. Both behaviors are **enabled by default**.

## Auto-save on exit

Sessions are saved automatically when:

- a client **detaches** (`prefix + d`),
- a client **disconnects** (terminal closed / connection dropped),
- a session is **closed** (`Ctrl-d` out of the last pane).

This is wired with the `client-detached` and `session-closed` tmux hooks. On
detach/disconnect the session is still alive, so its full contents are captured.

Disable it with:

    set -g @persist-save-on-exit 'off'

### Saving on `Ctrl-d` (shell integration)

`Ctrl-d` is special. It makes the shell exit, which closes the pane and then the
session. By the time tmux fires `pane-exited` / `session-closed`, the pane is
already gone — its contents can no longer be captured. So the auto-save hooks
alone leave a `Ctrl-d`-closed session with only its most recent snapshot (the
last detach or manual save).

To save *at the moment of* `Ctrl-d`, save from the shell just before it exits,
while the pane is still alive. This only saves; it does not change what `Ctrl-d`
does. Add the snippet for your shell to its rc file. `@persist-save-script-path`
is set by the plugin, so you never hardcode the path.

bash, ksh, dash, POSIX `sh` — `trap … EXIT` (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.kshrc`, `$ENV`):

    if [ -n "$TMUX" ]; then
      _persist_save_on_exit() {
        script="$(tmux show-option -gqv @persist-save-script-path)"
        [ -n "$script" ] && "$script" quiet "$(tmux display-message -p '#{client_session}')" >/dev/null 2>&1
      }
      trap _persist_save_on_exit EXIT
    fi

zsh (`~/.zshrc`) — uses the `zshexit` hook:

    if [ -n "$TMUX" ]; then
      zshexit() {
        local script; script="$(tmux show-option -gqv @persist-save-script-path)"
        [ -n "$script" ] && "$script" quiet "$(tmux display-message -p '#{client_session}')" >/dev/null 2>&1
      }
    fi

fish (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`) — uses the `fish_exit` event:

    if set -q TMUX
      function __persist_save_on_exit --on-event fish_exit
        set -l script (tmux show-option -gqv @persist-save-script-path)
        test -n "$script"; and "$script" quiet (tmux display-message -p '#{client_session}') >/dev/null 2>&1
      end
    end

`csh`/`tcsh` have no exit hook, so this trick is not possible there; rely on the
detach/disconnect auto-save instead.

## Auto-restore on session creation

When a session is created, its saved contents are restored automatically (using
the `session-created` hook). Create a session named like a saved one and it
comes back with its windows, panes and pane contents:

    tmux new -s my-project

Sessions with no saved snapshot are left untouched and produce no message.

Disable it with:

    set -g @persist-auto-restore 'off'

## Manual save and restore

The key bindings still work and act on the **current** session only:

- `prefix + Ctrl-s` — save the session you are attached to
- `prefix + Ctrl-r` — restore the session you are attached to

To restore a specific session by name from the shell:

    $ ~/path/to/tmux-persist/scripts/restore.sh <session-name>
