# Restoring previously saved environment

Each session is saved separately. The files for a session named `foo` look
like this (one timestamped snapshot per save, plus a `foo_last` symlink to
the most recent one):

    foo_20260619T184107.tgz
    foo_20260619T184108.tgz
    foo_last -> foo_20260619T184108.tgz

Each `.tgz` bundles that snapshot's layout and pane contents together - see
[restoring pane contents](restoring_pane_contents.md) for the on-disk format,
including the alternate `separate` layout (`@persist-snapshot-format`).

None of the previous saves are deleted (unless you explicitly do that). All save
files are kept in `~/.tmux/persist/` directory, or `~/.local/share/tmux/persist`
(unless `${XDG_DATA_HOME}` says otherwise).<br/>

`prefix + Ctrl-r` restores the session you are currently attached to. To restore
a specific session by name, run the restore script with the session as an
argument:

    $ ~/path/to/tmux-persist/scripts/restore.sh foo

## Restoring everything at once

If you've lost the whole tmux server (a crash, a reboot, `tmux kill-server`)
and want every saved session back, not just one, run the restore script with
`all` instead of a session name:

    $ ~/path/to/tmux-persist/scripts/restore.sh all

This recreates every session that has a saved snapshot - sessions, windows,
panes, working directories, layout and foreground processes - in one pass.
It's the bulk counterpart to `scripts/save.sh all`, which
`@persist-save-on-exit`'s hooks already use for the same reason (no single
"current session" to target).

Which pane/window/session had focus is restored too. That needs a real
attached client (`switch-client`), which usually doesn't exist yet at the
point you'd run this - right after starting a fresh, otherwise-empty tmux
server. If no client is attached yet, focus restoration is deferred until
one actually attaches; everything else (sessions, windows, panes, working
directories, layout, foreground processes) comes back immediately either
way.

There's no key binding for this (same as `save.sh all`, which is also
script/hook-only) - run it directly, or wire it into your own tmux startup
if you want it automatic.

Here are the steps to restore a session to a previous point in time:

- `$ cd ~/.tmux/persist/`
- locate the snapshot you'd like to use for restore (file names have a timestamp)
- point the session's `last` symlink at it: `$ ln -sf <session>_<timestamp>.tgz <session>_last`
  (`.txt` instead of `.tgz` if you're on `@persist-snapshot-format 'separate'`)
- create a session with that name and do a restore with the `tmux-persist` key:
  `prefix + Ctrl-r`

You should now be restored to the time when that snapshot was saved.
