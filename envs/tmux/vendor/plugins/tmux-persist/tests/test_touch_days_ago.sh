# "-f format" (a custom output string, where %m is mtime), but GNU
# coreutils stat's -f means something unrelated - report FILESYSTEM status
# instead of file status, where %m means mount point instead. Trying BSD's
# form first and falling back to GNU's on failure doesn't work, because
# GNU's stat -f doesn't fail on the wrong platform - it exits 0 and prints
# filesystem info that looks superficially plausible but corrupts any
# arithmetic that consumes it, so the fallback never triggers. Trying GNU's
# form first instead fixes this: on BSD, stat -c fails cleanly ("illegal
# option"), correctly triggering the fallback to the BSD form.
