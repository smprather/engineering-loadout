# `restore all` retry-on-mismatch behavior: a `tmux kill-server` used to
# recreate a bulk-restore source session returns before the server finishes
# reaping child panes (measured ~0ms for 1 pane, ~3.4s for 100 panes,
# ~33ms/pane), so restore_all_sessions() can start restoring a session while
# its old panes are still mid-teardown on the same socket and silently lose
# it. This file is written against the fix as specified (see the task/spec
# this branch was started from), BEFORE restore_all_sessions() has been
# changed to implement it - restore.sh is untouched on this branch. Every
# assertion below therefore describes intended behavior, not current
# behavior; substantive failures here are expected until the retry logic is
# implemented.
#
# Rather than depending on real kill-server teardown timing (slow and racy to
# reproduce on demand), these tests manufacture a deterministic pane-count
# mismatch: @persist-hook-pre-restore-pane-processes (fires once per
# restore_structure() attempt - see execute_hook in helpers.sh, confirmed
# against docs/hooks.md) is armed to kill one live pane in a specific target
# session, gated by a flag file so the exact attempt(s) it fires on are
# controlled. See set_sabotage_hook, restore_capture_stderr(_bg),
# set_counter_hook and poll_until in test_helpers.sh.
#
# Note: the spec's own shorthand for reading a session's live pane count -
# `tmux list-panes -t "$session" -a` - is what the implementation is expected
# to use internally, but it is not session-scoped for OUR assertions: tmux's
# -a flag lists every pane on the whole server and ignores -t entirely. This
# file's own checks use live_pane_count() (`list-panes -s -t`) instead, which
# actually scopes to one session.
