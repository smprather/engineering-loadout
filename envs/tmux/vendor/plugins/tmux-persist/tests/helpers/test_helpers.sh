# immediately by the next case's setup() starting a fresh server on the
# SAME socket path can hit that exact race between test cases, producing
# "server exited unexpectedly"/"no server running" failures that have
# nothing to do with whatever that next case is actually testing. Waits for

# Arms tmux's own native after-new-window/after-split-window hooks (NOT

# belonging to session $1 the instant restore_all_panes() creates one,
# manufacturing a reproducible pane-count mismatch without depending on real
# kill-server teardown timing. These fire synchronously as part of the same
# tmux command that creates the pane/window - confirmed directly, no race.
# Deliberately NOT using @persist-hook-pre-restore-pane-processes: that fires
# once per session (not once per pane, and not during retries - see
# restore_structure_properties() in restore.sh), so it can't manufacture a
# mismatch *during* the retry-safe creation step the fix actually retries.
#
# Deliberately NOT after-new-session either: that fires on a session's
# FIRST/only pane, and killing a session's only pane kills the whole
# session with it - confirmed directly, this cascades into restore.sh's own
# SUBSEQUENT commands (e.g. select-pane on a pane index that never got
# created, split-window against a session that no longer exists) failing
# with real, unrelated tmux errors ("can't find session", "can't find
# pane") that leak onto stderr and are easily mistaken for this fix's own
# failure-reporting output. Restricting to after-new-window/after-split-window
# guarantees the target session's first pane is never touched, so a kill
# only ever removes one of several panes - a clean, non-destructive
# mismatch, not a session-destroying one.
#
# The kill logic lives in a standalone script file, not an inline quoted
# string: a hook's VALUE goes through tmux's own command parser AND its
# format-expansion, and the kill logic needs its own nested quotes/braces
# (`[ -n "$p" ]`, `#{pane_id}`) - inlined, those collide with the hook
# string's own quoting and get prematurely format-expanded (confirmed
# directly: both broke silently, one as a parse error, one as a literal
# pane id spliced into the command text before the nested list-panes call
# ever saw it). A script file sidesteps both: its contents are never parsed
# or format-expanded by tmux at all, only executed by bash.
#   mode "once"   - kills a pane only the first time $1 actually has 2+ live
#                   panes, then never again (tracked via flag file $3) - used
#                   to make exactly one attempt fail before a clean retry.
#   mode "always" - kills a pane every time $1 has 2+ live panes - used to
#                   make every attempt fail (persistent-failure cases). For a
#                   session with only ever 1 saved pane, this mode never
#                   fires (nothing non-first to kill) - use a multi-pane
#                   session for persistent-failure test cases.
#   $3 unused in "always" mode.
# Other sessions restored in the same run are unaffected: these are global
# hooks (fire for every session's creation events), but the kill command
# itself targets session $1 by name, so it's a no-op for any other session.

# interactive attach. Left with stdin already at EOF, though, it exits
# (`%exit`) immediately after attaching, before anything can rely on it
# still being attached. Holding its stdin open against a FIFO that we also
# hold open on our side (`exec N<>fifo`, both ends) keeps it attached
# indefinitely, until we explicitly close our end and kill it.
